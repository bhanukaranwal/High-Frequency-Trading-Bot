High-Frequency Trading Bot: Ultra-Efficient, Modular, and Feature-Rich VWAP Execution EngineProject ObjectiveThis open-source, production-grade high-frequency trading (HFT) bot is designed to execute sophisticated, low-latency trading strategies—including VWAP-driven execution, market making, arbitrage, and scalping—across multiple exchanges and asset classes. The bot is engineered to be highly efficient, customizable, and suitable for both backtesting and live deployment in real-world trading environments.Core FeaturesMulti-Exchange & Multi-Asset Support: Trade equities, crypto, and forex across multiple exchanges with pluggable API connectors.Advanced Strategy Engine: VWAP, TWAP, market making, arbitrage, and custom execution algorithms with deep learning integration support.Ultra-Low Latency & High Throughput: Asynchronous, event-driven architecture optimized for microsecond-level execution.Real-Time Data Processing: Millisecond-level streaming of tick data, order book depth, and on-the-fly indicator calculation.Sophisticated Order Management: Advanced order types, dynamic order book positioning, and smart order routing.Robust Risk Management: Automated position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, and real-time risk monitoring.Backtesting & Simulation: High-fidelity backtesting engine with tick-level data replay and performance analytics.Extensible & Modular: Easily add new strategies, exchanges, or data sources through a clean, modular codebase.Robust Infrastructure: Written in Python 3.10+ with Dockerized deployment for portability and reproducibility.Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.10+Docker (recommended)An exchange API key for live tradingInstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/hft-bot.git
cd hft-bot
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the bot:Rename config.example.yaml to config.yaml.Edit config.yaml to add your exchange API keys, define trading strategies, and set risk parameters.Running the BotDirectly:python main.py
With Docker:docker-compose up --build
Architecture OverviewThe bot is built on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture. Core components are decoupled and communicate through a central event engine.Event Engine (event_engine.py): The heart of the system, queuing and dispatching events (e.g., TICK, ORDER, FILL).Exchange Connectors (connectors/): Modules for connecting to different exchanges. They normalize data and send it to the event engine.Strategy Engine (strategy_engine.py): Loads and runs trading strategies. Strategies receive market data events and generate signal events.Order Manager (order_manager.py): Receives signal events, creates orders, and sends them to the exchange. It manages the lifecycle of an order.Risk Manager (risk_manager.py): Intercepts order creation events to check them against pre-defined risk rules before execution.Data Handler (data_handler.py): Subscribes to market data streams and generates TICK events.Performance Analytics (analytics/): Logs all trades and provides performance metrics.Example Use Cases“Buy 500 shares of TSLA between 09:30–09:45 at VWAP minus 0.1%, using aggressive limit orders and fallback to market orders if liquidity is thin.”“Market-make on BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, maintaining a dynamic spread and adjusting order sizes based on real-time volatility.”“Exploit cross-exchange arbitrage between Binance and Kraken using latency-optimized order routing.”Contribution GuidelinesWe welcome contributions!
